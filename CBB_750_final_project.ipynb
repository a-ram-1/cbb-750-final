The hope is that, by boosting, we'll be able to target points likely to have been misclassified by our non-boosting GLM and improve prediction accuracy. There's a nice description of AdaBoost [here](https://blog.paperspace.com/adaboost-optimizer/) as well as [here](https://codesachin.wordpress.com/tag/adaboost/). "
