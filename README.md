### Classifying cardiomyopathy v. coronary artery disease for patients with and without vectorized text data

A Ram, Jason Liu, Saejeong Park, Sarah Dudgeon

**NOTE: all scripts will need to be reuploaded once fully commented**


Here are the files included in this repo [note: we are not including MIMIC files as they are access-controlled]: 
* exploratory.Rmd
	* Sarah's R script that filters out unique patients based on whether or not they have text notes in MIMIC's NOTEEVENTS table
* SubID\_ICD\_Diseases.ipynb_ 
	* Saejeong's python notebook that finds subject ids for cardiomyopathy/coronary artery disease patients using MIMIC's D\_ICD\_DIAGNOSES and DIAGNOSES\_ICD tables
